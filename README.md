First and foremost, I'm impressed. Very impressed.<br>
This project has been abandoned for a while but discord has properly patched the moficiation of their audio,<br>
to the point where applications like ripcord are completely non functional now.<br>		 
I have nothing but respect to the discord developers who probably accidentally fixed it.<br>		 
I'm not continuing the plugin, nor am i going to work on a fixed version.<br>		 
The community of "audio guys" on discord is a complete and utter overflowing toilet of ego and toxicity.<br>		
<br>
Oh and FYI, Nothing below is functional anymore.<br>
Don't ask for support in my discord 'cause YOU AINT GETTIN IT
